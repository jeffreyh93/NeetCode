What is the difference between declaration and definition of a variable/function
- in the case of variable when declaring, we are giving the variable a data type and giving it a name
    - when defining the variable, we are declaring it and giving it a value
- in the case of function when declaring, we are declaring the return type, name, and arguments
    - when defining the function, we are declaring it and giving the function body and identifying what values to return when exiting

What are different storage class specifiers in C?
- auto = default for variables, means we are giving it local scope
- extern = extends the scope of the variable, useful when we want to access a variable from another file
- static = the value of the variable persists even when exiting the scope, only initialized once
- register = useful when we want repetitive access to the variable, stores the cpu register instead of memory

What is scope of a variable? How are variables scoped in C?
- it defines the lifetime of the variable from which we can access it. by default it is local / auto scoped

How will you print "Hello World" without the use of semicolon?

int main() {
    if (printf("Hello World")) {}
}

When should we use pointers in our C program?
- When we want to simulate pass by reference
    - any change to the variable passed by reference to the function will have its reflected outside of the function
- To get the address of the variable or function

What is NULL pointer?
- indicates that the pointer does not point to a valid location, ideal to use when we don't know the value at time of declaration

What is dangling pointer?
- pointer that references a location in memory and has been freed / deleted
    - the pointer that still references that location is called dangling

What is memory leak?
- in cases where we have allocated memory then the program exits scope without the use of free or deallocation
- since memory is still being consumed by the program, it can cause memory leaks

What are local static variables? What is their use?
- local static variables are used to have a variable preserve its value after the program exits scope
- any additional call to that function will have its value preserved, only initialized once

What are static functions? What is their use?
- by default, functions are global by default which means all files that include it will be able to call the function
- if we define a function as static, only the file in which it is defined can use that function. It is useful when we want to give the same name to a function but provide different definitions across different files

What are the
