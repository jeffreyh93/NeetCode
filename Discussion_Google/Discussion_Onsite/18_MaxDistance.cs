The distance between 2 binary strings is the sum of their lengths after removing the common prefix. For example: the common prefix of 1011000 and 1011110 is 1011 so the distance is len("000") + len("110") = 3 + 3 = 6.

Given a list of binary strings, pick a pair that gives you maximum distance among all possible pair and return that distance.
